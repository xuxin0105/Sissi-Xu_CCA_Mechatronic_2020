Mechatronic HW &amp; Exercise
# Week 7 (Midterm)
-Obstacle Avoiding Car Project (Group: Sissi, Zoey, Tianbai)

-Through this project, I learned to use the distance sensor. And use it to control four motors. When the distance between the obstacle and the car is less than 30, the inner wheels do not turn, and the car turns. Doing by the team, we can learn from each other and use teamates' strengths and also experience a large range of hardware with a well-accomplished project.

# Week 6
-This week I tried to make a car with moving wheels. I made an AI file that can be laser cut this car on cardboard, and the size needs to be further adjusted.

- In class, We decided to set up a team to build an electric car that could avoid obstacles. Doing by the team, we can learn from each other and use teamates' strengths and also experience a large range of hardware with a well-accomplished project.

# Week 5
- This week I tried a new color sensor TCS34725 to identify the color of RGB, and my goal is to display the color on the led. But I face some connection problem, the light of my RGB did not light up. After several attempts, I still don't know where the issue is.

-Update: I got this fixed in class.

# Week 4
-This week I did a small LED project: I decided to use a button to control the led. There are three LEDs total; they will switch light up every time I push the button.
