Mechatronic HW &amp; Exercise

## Week 5
- This week I tried a new color sensor TCS34725 to identify the color of RGB, and my goal is to display the color on the led. But I face some connection problem, the light of my RGB did not light up. After several attempts, I still don't know where the issue is.

# Week 4
-This week I did a small LED project: I decided to use a button to control the led. There are three LEDs total; they will switch light up every time I push the button.
